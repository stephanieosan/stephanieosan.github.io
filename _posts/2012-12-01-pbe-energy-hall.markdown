An intro here.


### Faraday Dynamo

For this exhibit, two museum visitors compete to generate the most electricity by spinning the Faraday Dynamo wheels fastest. This digital readout accompanies the physical exhibit, measuring and comparing their output to other forms of energy.

### Energy Questions
Energy Questions is a touchscreen application that allows museum-goers to debate current energy issues. 

[Need an image here.]


### Exhibit wayfinding and signage

I designed all of the exhibit signage and wayfinding. This process included presenting to and collaborating with multi-million dollar donors to create signage to recognize their contributions to the museum. I also oversaw the production of the signage and managed relationships with vendors.

[Need a wayfinding signage image.]
