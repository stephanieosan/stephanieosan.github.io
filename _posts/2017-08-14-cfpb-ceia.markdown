AskCFPB is the CFPB’s largest set of financial education resources. It includes thousands of answers to common questions that cover a broad range of financial products and topics, and it drives the majority of organic traffic to CFPB’s website. 

The problems we were trying to solve with a redesign:
* Being one of our original (and oldest) web products, AskCFPB was not responsive, which was a significant issue, given that ~30% of visitors were mobile users.
* Usability testing uncovered that users had difficulty navigating within the AskCFPB pages.
* Because AskCFPB content is our largest source of organic traffic, our stakeholders wanted to create pathways from AskCFPB into other relevant CFPB financial education content.

[Something about the hero exploration.]
As a part of this project, we had the opportunity to design an image to represent the tool on its landing page.

This project was completed as a part of a team of in-house CFPB designers and developers that I led.
