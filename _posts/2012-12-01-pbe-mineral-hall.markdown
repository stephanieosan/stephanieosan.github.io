Here's a description of the Gems and Minerals Hall! 


### Mineral Matrix

The Mineral Matrix is a nine-screen interactive video wall that houses a database of mineral specimen videos. These minerals are held in private collections across the US, consequently, they have rarely been seen by the public at large. 

I designed the touch-screen interface that controls the video wall, allowing visitors to compare minerals from the database by trait, look up information about a specific mineral, and view minerals across all nine screens.

### Mobile Mineral Cart

The Mobile Mineral Cart is a custom touch table exhibit that houses four activities: a matching game, a mineral quiz, a puzzle, and a mineral facts section. The application was designed to be accessed by multiple visitors at time from either long side of the touch table.

### Mineral case label system

I also designed an interactive label system for the cases containing mineral specimens. This allows museum visitors to look up more information about the gems and minerals displayed in the exhibit hall.
