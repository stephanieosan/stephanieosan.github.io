One of the core services CFPB offers to the public is the ability to submit complaints related to financial products and institutions. We accept complaints across channels online through a web form, over the phone, and via mail. For this project, my team redesigned the landing page for the complaint forms and upgraded the existing form design.

This project was completed in collaboration with other CFPB designers and developers, Stephen Kennedy and Ben Guhin. 

The current version of the CFPB Complaint tool [can be found here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint). The design has been further refined by colleagues since my team's redesign.
