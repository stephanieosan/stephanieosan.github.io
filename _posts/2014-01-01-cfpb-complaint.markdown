One of the core services CFPB offers to the public is the ability to submit complaints related to financial products and institutions. We accept complaints across channels online through a web form, over the phone, and via mail. For this project, my team redesigned the landing page for the complaint forms and upgraded the existing form design. I also redesigned the paper complaint forms that allow consumers to mail in their complaints to the bureau.

As a part of this project, I:
* Considered the complaint experience across multiple channels
* Analyzed the shortcomings of the existing page, presenting analysis to stakeholders to garner buy-in to redesign the page
* Designed multiple distinct directions, presented to stakeholders for feedback on tone
* Conducted usability testing to gauge performance of the pages and forms, then adapt design based on test results
* Collaborated with internal developers and contractors to ensure pages were built according to designs
* Introduced and designed new pages explaining the complaint process and how the CFPB uses complaint data

This project was completed in collaboration with other CFPB designers and developers, Stephen Kennedy and Ben Guhin. 

The current version of the CFPB Complaint tool [can be found here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint). The design has been further refined by colleagues since my team's redesign.
