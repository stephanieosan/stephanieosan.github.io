AskCFPB is the CFPB’s largest set of financial education resources. It includes thousands of answers to common questions that cover a broad range of financial products and topics, and it drives the majority of organic traffic to CFPB’s website. 

The problems we were trying to solve with a redesign:
Being one of our original (and oldest) web products, AskCFPB was not responsive, which was a significant issue, given that ~30% of visitors were mobile users.
Usability testing uncovered that users had difficulty navigating within the AskCFPB pages.
Because AskCFPB content is our largest source of organic traffic, our stakeholders wanted to create pathways from AskCFPB into other relevant CFPB financial education content.
