[Ask CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb) is the CFPB’s largest set of financial education resources. It includes thousands of answers to common questions that cover a broad range of financial products and topics, and it drives the majority of organic traffic to CFPB’s website. 

Goals for the redesign:

1. **Identify the CFPB on each page**
	* Increase credibility of the site—many users are coming from organic traffic and do not know who the CFPB is 
2. **Make it easy for users to find answers** 
	* Usability testing and analysis of analytics uncovered that users had 
3. **Create entry points for other cf.gov resources** 
	* Because Ask CFPB content is our largest source of organic traffic, our stakeholders wanted to create pathways from AskCFPB into other relevant CFPB financial education content.
4. **Make the tool mobile-friendly**
5. **Update the look and feel to match the evolution of the CFPB brand**

### Hero image and photography exploration

As a part of this project, we had the opportunity to design an image to represent the tool on its landing page. Before this point, editorial photography was rarely used as a part of the CFPB's brand. Through this image, we explored the intersection of depicting the CFPB (a neutral financial expert), the product (a vast dataset of action-oriented information), and the consumer (who comes to the site for financial advice) to express and reinforce the value proposition of the Ask CFPB tool.
