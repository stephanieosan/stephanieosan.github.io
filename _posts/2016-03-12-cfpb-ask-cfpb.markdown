Ask CFPB is the CFPB’s largest set of financial education resources. It includes thousands of answers to common questions that cover a broad range of financial products and topics, and it drives the majority of organic traffic to CFPB’s website. 

Goals for the redesign:

1) Identify the CFPB on each page
	* Many users are coming from organic traffic and do not know who the CFPB is. Increase the credibility of the site, 
2) Make it easy for users to find answers 
	* Usability testing and analysis of analytics uncovered that users had difficulty navigating within the Ask CFPB pages.
3) Create entry points for other cf.gov resources  
	* Because Ask CFPB content is our largest source of organic traffic, our stakeholders wanted to create pathways from AskCFPB into other relevant CFPB financial education content.
4) Make the tool mobile-friendly
5) Update the look and feel to match the evolution of the CFPB brand

### Hero image and photography exploration

As a part of this project, we had the opportunity to design an image to represent the tool on its landing page. Before this point, editorial photography was rarely used as a part of the CFPB's brand. Through this image, we explored the intersection of depicting the CFPB (a neutral financial expert), the product (a vast dataset of action-oriented information), and the consumer (who comes to the site for financial advice) to express and reinforce the value proposition of the Ask CFPB tool.
